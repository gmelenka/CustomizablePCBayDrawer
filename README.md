# Customizable PC Bay Drawer

![Customizable PC Bay Drawer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gmelenka/CustomizablePCBayDrawer/master/images/pcBayDrawer01.JPG)

This is a customizable drawer that can be used with any 5.25" PC drive bay. Many computers have additional bays so why not put them to use?. 
This drawer was created to store PC related parts like USB keys, and SD cards.

The dimensions for the drawer were measured for an ANTEC 300 PC tower. 
Make sure to measure your PC bays and use the Customizer to adjust the drawer size to meet your needs.

Note: the drawer can take a long time to render when using OpenSCAD. 
To improve rendering times either reduce the number of holes added to the front face of the drawer or remove the holes on the front face altogether.  
Front face holes are entirely cosmetic, they were added to match the front grill of my PC case.

Edit 2016/07/18

I've added a new drawer option which will add a hole rather than a tab or handle for the drawer. 
This way you can still open the drawer but there won't be a tab or handle that could potentially break off.
